# audio_preprocessor

Under development now

#### Goal
To create a single HDF file,
* that contains all the transforms of the audio files,
  * that are in a certain folder,
* where the transforms can be specified w.r.t [librosa](http://librosa.github.io)
* and so as the extensions of audio files
* with a random order for training,
* using multiprocessing

and I'm gonna use it for the training of my neural networks.

#### The structure of HDF 
If melgram, cqt, stft have been acquired, there would be `f.items() = ['melgram', 'cqt', 'stft']`. 
Each dataset would be 4-dim numpy array, e.g. `f['melgram'].shape = (1000, 1, 128, 200)` when there is 1000 songs, `1` channel, `n_mels`=128, `n_frame`=200 (same is the formatting in Theano).

#### How to use
1. Create  or modify [settings.json](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/audio_preprocessor/blob/master/settings.json)
2. As in the [example.py](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/audio_preprocessor/blob/master/example.py),
```	
import audio_preprocessor

nogada = audio_preprocessor.Audio_Preprocessor(settings_path='settings.json')
nogada.index()
nogada.get_permutations()
nogada.convert_all()
```
